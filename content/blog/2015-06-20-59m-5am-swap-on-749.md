From spare part manuals, I found that main wiring has different part
numbers:

### 749s 2005

    510.1.390.1A - front wiring
    510.1.391.1A - main wiring

### 749 2003

    510.1.243.1A - front wiring
    510.1.256.1B - main wiring

### 749 dark 2005

    510.1.391.1A - main wiring


But, from 
[this ducatiforum thread][this ducatiforum thread]
it seems that the ecu are swappable. 

Even better, it seems that the 
immobilizer works in different way in newer ecu, so just put the correct 
firmware seems to "virginize" the ecu.
