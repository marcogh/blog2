# About me

I'm a full stack developer with a deep love for the Linux operating system, that
I'm using since 1994.

I have a Master's Degree in Electronic Engineering - Information Technology -
and I'm an enthusiast of the tecnology in all of its form.

I felt in love of recent web technologies and i think that learning is one of
the great joy of our lives. 

I'm a father of two wonderful and dreadful daughters.
